# Dealing with `matdyn.x`s wrong total weight problem

`matdyn.x` will produce the wrong total weight error when the accuracies of atom position is
not sufficient. Here is how to tune the program to avoid such a problem without losing too
much precision.

## Definition of Problem

When running `matdyn.x`, it raises the following error:

```
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    task #         0
    from frc_blk : error #         1
    wrong total_weight
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
```

Such error locates in file [`matdyn.f90`](https://github.com/QEF/q-e/blob/335abfac7c2c65b0066d19741d1a0a2b91882600/PHonon/PH/matdyn.f90#L988).

## Cause and Explanation

The subroutine
[`frc_blk`](https://github.com/QEF/q-e/blob/335abfac7c2c65b0066d19741d1a0a2b91882600/PHonon/PH/matdyn.f90#L939)
in `matdyn.f90` calculates the dynamical matrix at each q-point from the force constants. It
uses subroutine
[`wsweight`](https://github.com/QEF/q-e/blob/7d5cebcf1250114756b88c6064ebe82e6f8fd835/PW/src/wsweight.f90#L37)
to calculate whether everything should be in the Wignerâ€“Seitz cell is there. The `wsweight`
subroutine uses a `eps` parameter to determine whether a point is on the vertex. If the atom
coordinates is not accurate enough, this might be wrong.

## Steps for Resolving the Problem

1. Edit file `$QE_HOME/pw/src/wsweight.f90`, lower the value for parameter `eps` to maybe
   `1.0d-4`.
2. Go to `$QE_HOME/pw/src` and run `make libpw.a` to recompile `libpw.a`.
3. Go to `$QE_HOME/PHonon/PH` and run `make matdyn.x` to recompile `matdyn.x`.

### Problem that might cause recompilation unsuccessful

Some external libraries dependencies might cause compiling of this component unsuccessful.
Check out `$QE_HOME/make.inc`. In my case, I removed all [ELPA](https://elpa.mpcdf.mpg.de/)
related items.
